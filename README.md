# pandas-challenge
I chose to do the heroes of pymoli for the pandas challenge. 
Each cell of the code does something different.
the first cell imports pandas and reads the relevent csv file.
the next cell counts the number of unique screen names to find the total number of players.
after that is a dataframe containing a general purchasing analysis, showing the average amount people spent on the game, the number items, etc.
Then i seperated the data by gender in one cell then did another analysis in the following cell.
The following two cells look age age demographics and another purchasing analysis seperated by age.
Finally, The program looked into who spend the most money on the game and the most profitible items in the game.
